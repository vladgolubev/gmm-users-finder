GMM Users Finder
=================
The main purpose of this tiny java application is to seek for active Google Map Maker users on certain territory. It grabs their `uid` with nickname and puts into Google Spreadsheet or `.csv` file. 

To set up it for own use you have to follow these steps:
* [Download](https://github.com/samosfator/gmm-users-finder/releases) and unzip latest release
* Create a Google Spreadsheet and name two first columns as `uid` and `username`
* Fill in `.config` file with **correct** information
* Add a territory to `Neighborhoods` list in your Map Maker account
* Double click on `launch.bat`
